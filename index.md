-Produced a graph to see the sharpe ratio

### How to optimize portfolio for minimum variance

-Convert close prices to lo log
-Get bencnhmark returns (S&P 500)
-Calculate expected returns with CAPM
-Calculate covariance to obtain the efficient frontier
-Use the efficient frontier to get the optimal weights for minimum volatility
